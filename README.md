QR.cpp optimization with compiler
Here you'll find a solver for n equation and n variable system with a QR decomposition
matrix BIG is the matrix of the vector you want to solve. A is the matrix corresponding of the system
remove all the //! to see the result on the terminal and see every iteration of the QR decomposition.

the code is not well optimize YET.
please if anyone use one day this code tell me i would like to know if this thing will be one day usefull to someone.
